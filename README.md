# breast-cancer-detection-with-neural-networks
 Detecting breast cancer using neural networks involves building and training a model to classify whether breast cancer is present based on input data. The following example uses TensorFlow/Keras to create a simple neural network to perform this task on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is included in the sklearn library.
